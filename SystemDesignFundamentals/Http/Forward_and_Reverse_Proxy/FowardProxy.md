## Why Forward Proxy :

#### Anonymity and Privacy :
* A forward proxy hides the client's IP address, providing an extra layer of privacy and security.
  This is particularly useful when accessing external APIs or services that might have rate limits 
  or geo-restrictions.


#### Access Control :
* Forward proxies can control and monitor internet usage within an organization.They can block access 
  to certain websites,  ensuring that only approved resources are accessed.

* Example schools can block social media and gaming websites.


#### Caching :
* Proxies can cache frequently requested resources, we can use the cache for repeated Requests
  that will reduce load time and bandwidth and also improve the performance.
                      
#### Security:
* By filtering and blocking malicious websites requests , forward proxies can protect internal networks 
  from external threats.<br><br>
