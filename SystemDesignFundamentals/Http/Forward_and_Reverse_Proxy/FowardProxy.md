  to certain websites,  ensuring that only approved resources are accessed.

* Example schools can block social media and gaming websites.


#### Caching :
* Proxies can cache frequently requested resources, we can use the cache for repeated Requests
  that will reduce load time and bandwidth and also improve the performance.

* By filtering and blocking malicious websites requests , forward proxies can protect internal networks 
  from external threats.<br><br>
