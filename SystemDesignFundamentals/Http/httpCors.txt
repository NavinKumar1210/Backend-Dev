Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ( CORS ) :
                                        * CORS is a Security feauture in web browser that allows a web page to request
                                          Resources from other Server than it's own.It is important because web browsers 
                                          enforce same-origin-policy that restrict cross origin requests by default to 
                                          protect users from malicious websites

CORS headers :

                * Access-Control-Allow-Origin - Specifies which origins can access the resource. eg: https://example.com
                                                

                * Access-Control-Allow-Methods - HTTP methods (e.g : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that are allowed when
                                                 accessing the resource.

                * Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates whether the request can include user credentials 
                                                    like cookies and HTTP authentication.
                            

Preflight Requests : 
                    * For certain types of requests ( PUT,PATCH ), the browser sends a preliminary request 
                     (OPTIONS method) to check if the actual request is allowed

Security Considerations:
                         * Be cautious with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * as it allows any website to access your resources,
                            which can be a security risk.
