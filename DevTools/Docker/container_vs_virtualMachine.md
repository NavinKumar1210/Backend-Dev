# Container vs virtual machine :

## Container :
* container virtualize operating system kernals
* Don't emulate the hardware so no need to boot up
* Take up much less space
* can run only one app at a time usually
* can interact with the host

## Virtual machine :
* Virtual machine virtualize the hardware
* we need to install software and files manually because VM acts as the real hardware
so it can take up a lot of space
* VM use hypervisor to emulate the real hardware
* can run multiple apps
* cannot interact with the hosts
