# What is Docker?
## The Problem
Imagine you've built an amazing app on your development machine, and it works perfectly. But, when you try to run it on a client's machine, it just doesn't work. This can be frustrating!

## Why Does This Happen?
There are several reasons why this might happen:

* Missing tools: The client's machine might not have all the necessary tools or software installed.
* Different configurations: The client's machine might have different settings or configurations that affect how the app runs.
* Hardware dependencies: The app might rely on specific hardware components that are not present on the client's machine.
* Docker is a solution to this problem. It allows you to package your app and all its dependencies into a single container, called a Docker container. This container includes everything the app needs to run, including the Docker image, which is like a blueprint for the container.

## The Cooking Recipe Analogy
* Think of it like sharing a cooking recipe with someone. You give them the recipe, but when they try to make it, it doesn't taste the same as yours. Why? Because they might be using different ingredients, cooking utensils, or even a different stove!

* To solve this problem, you could provide a box that contains everything needed to make the recipe, including the ingredients, utensils, and cooking instructions. This box is like a Docker container. The recipe is like the Docker image, which provides the instructions for creating the container.
