# Namespace and control groups :
Docker uses Linux control groups and namespaces for container management.

## Namespace :
* Limits what you can see
* Don't emulate the hardware so no need to boot up
* Take up much less space
* can run only one app at a time usually
* can interact with the host

## control groups :
* Limits how much of any resource you can use
* Monitor and restrict cpu usage
* Monitor and restrict network bandwidth and disk bandwidth
* Monitor and restrict memory consumption
* cannot interact with the hosts

## Docker Limitations :
* Natively only run on linux
* Container images are bound to their parent OS
