# k8s_namespaces :

* In Kubernetes, a namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or applications
* kubectl get ... -A - to get all the namespaces in k8s
* kubectl create ns <namespace name> - create the namespace

### Use Cases :
* Resource isolation: Namespaces provide a way to isolate resources between different users, teams, or applications.
* Name uniqueness: Namespaces ensure that object names are unique within a namespace, but can be reused in other namespaces.
* Security: Namespaces can be used to implement security policies, such as controlling access to resources based on namespace membership.
* Organization: Namespaces can help organize resources in a large cluster, making it easier to manage and scale.
