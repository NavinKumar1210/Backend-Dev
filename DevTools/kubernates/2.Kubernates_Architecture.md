# Kubernates Architecture :
* Kubernates consist of control plane components and node components

### control plane components :
* kube-apiserver : provides access to the pods via api
* etcd : kubernates database to store all the data
* kube-scheduler : responsible for scheduling and assigning pods
* Kube-controller-manager : Manages all core kubernates process

### Node components :
* container runtime : The part that actually run the containers
* kubelet : kubelet has been contacted by kube scheduler to run the container in pods
* kube-proxy : kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.
